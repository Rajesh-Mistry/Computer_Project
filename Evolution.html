    <div class="b" id="Mec"><p class="bhead">Mechanical Computers (1600s-1800s)</p>
    <p id="Mec" class="bcont">Early computing devices were mechanical in nature, designed to perform basic arithmetic calculations. Notable examples include the slide rule, abacus, and Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical analytical engine.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="b" id="Vac"><p class="bhead">Vacuum Tube Computers (1930s-1950s)</p>
      <p id="Vac" class="bcont">The introduction of vacuum tubes allowed for the construction of electronic digital computers. Notable examples include the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC) and the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="b" id="Tra"><p class="bhead">Transistors (1950s-1960s)</p>
      <p class="bcont">The invention of transistors in the late 1940s marked a significant advancement in computer technology. Transistors replaced vacuum tubes, making computers smaller, faster, and more reliable. The first generation of computers used transistors, leading to the development of machines like the IBM 1401.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="b" id="IC"><p class="bhead">Integrated Circuits (1960s-1970s)</p>
      <p class="bcont">The integration of multiple transistors on a single chip, known as integrated circuits (ICs), was a major breakthrough. This second generation of computers allowed for even greater miniaturization and improved performance.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="Mic" class="b" ><p class="bhead">Microprocessors and Personal Computers (1970s-1980s)</p>
      <p id="Mic" class="bcont">The invention of the microprocessor, a single-chip CPU, revolutionized computing. Intel's 4004 microprocessor, released in 1971, marked the beginning of the microcomputer era. The 1980s saw the rise of personal computers (PCs), such as the IBM PC and the Apple Macintosh.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="b" id="GUI"><p class="bhead">Graphical User Interfaces and Networking (1980s-1990s)</p>
      <p class="bcont">The development of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) made computers more user-friendly. The widespread adoption of networking technologies, including the internet, transformed the way people accessed and shared information.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="b" id="Mob"><p class="bhead">Mobile and Wireless Computing (2000s)</p>
      <p class="bcont">The 21st century saw the proliferation of mobile computing devices like smartphones and tablets. Advances in wireless technologies enabled seamless connectivity and mobility.A mobile device is a portable electronic gadget that can fit in a pocket or handbag. </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="b" id="AI"><p class="bhead">Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Computing (Present and Future)</p>
      <p id="AI" class="bcont">Today, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are driving new applications and capabilities in computers. Research in quantum computing holds the promise of solving complex problems beyond the scope of classical computers.</p>
